/// SignalTemplates can be used to represent operations or tasks, like network
/// requests, where each invocation of start() will create a new underlying
/// operation. This ensures that consumers will receive the results, versus a
/// plain Signal, where the results might be sent before any observers are
/// attached.
///
/// Because of the behavior of start(), different Signals created from the
/// template may see a different version of Events. The Events may arrive in a
/// different order between Signals, or the stream might be completely
/// different!

	///
	/// If the Disposable returned from start() is disposed, the given
	/// CompositeDisposable will be disposed as well, at which point work should
	/// be cancelled, and any temporary resources cleaned up. The
