# 3.0

ReactiveCocoa 3.0 includes the first official Swift API, which is intended to
eventually supplant the Objective-C API entirely.

However, because migration is hard and time-consuming, and because Objective-C
is still in widespread use, 99% of RAC 2.x code will continue to work under RAC
3.0 without any changes.

Since the 3.0 changes are entirely additive, this document will discuss how
concepts from the Objective-C API map to the Swift API. For a complete diff of
all changes, see [the 3.0 pull
request](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/pull/1382).
