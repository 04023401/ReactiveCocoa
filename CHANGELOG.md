# 3.0

ReactiveCocoa 3.0 includes the first official Swift API, which is intended to
eventually supplant the Objective-C API entirely.

However, because migration is hard and time-consuming, and because Objective-C
is still in widespread use, 99% of RAC 2.x code will continue to work under RAC
3.0 without any changes.

Since the 3.0 changes are entirely additive, this document will discuss how
concepts from the Objective-C API map to the Swift API. For a complete diff of
all changes, see [the 3.0 pull
request](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/pull/1382).

## Additions

### Parameterized types

Thanks to Swift, it is now possible to express the type of value that a signal
can send. RAC also requires that the type of errors be specified.

For example, `Signal<Int, NSError>` is a signal that may send zero or more
integers, and which may send an error of type `NSError`.

If it is impossible for a signal to error out, the built-in `NoError` type
(which can be referred to, but never created) can be used to represent that
caseâ€”for example, `Signal<String, NoError>` is a signal that may send zero or
more strings, and which will _not_ send an error under any circumstances.

Together, these additions make it much simpler to reason about signal
interactions, and protect against several kinds of common bugs that occurred in
Objective-C.
