# Design Guidelines

This document contains guidelines for projects that want to make use of
ReactiveCocoa. The content here is heavily inspired by the [Rx Design
Guidelines](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2010/10/28/rx-design-guidelines.aspx).

This document assumes basic familiarity
with the features of ReactiveCocoa. The [Framework Overview][] is a better
resource for getting up to speed on the functionality provided by RAC.
