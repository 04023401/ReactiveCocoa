# Framework Overview

This document contains a high-level description of the different components
within the ReactiveCocoa framework, and an attempt to explain how they work
together and divide responsibilities. This is meant to be a starting point for
learning about new modules and finding more specific documentation.

For examples and understanding how to use RAC, see the [README](../README.md) or
the [Design Guidelines](DesignGuidelines.md).
